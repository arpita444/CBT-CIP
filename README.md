# Projects: Student Record Management System & Digital Calculator

This repository contains two independent projects:

## **1. Student Record Management System:**

   - **Description:** A system for managing student records, including features such as:
      - Adding new student records
      - Viewing student details
      - Searching for students
      - Updating student information
      - Deleting student records
    
   - **Technologies:** C++, libraries used: iostream

   - **How to run:**
       1. **Clone the repository:**
         ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/arpita444/CBT-CIP
         ```
      2. **Open in VS Code:** Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
      3. **Build and run:** 
         - **Using the integrated terminal:** 
            - Navigate to the `student_record_system` directory in the terminal.
            - Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code: 
              ```bash
              g++ -o student_record_system main.cpp [other_source_files.cpp] 
              ```
            - Run the executable:
              ```bash
              ./student_record_system
              ```
         - **Using a VS Code debugger:**
            - Create a launch configuration in VS Code (refer to VS Code documentation for details).
            - Debug and run the application.

## **2. Digital Calculator:**

   - **Description:** A basic calculator application with features such as:
      - Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
      - Memory functions (e.g., store, recall, clear)
      - User interface (e.g., command-line interface) 

   - **Technologies:** C++, libraries used: iostream, cmath

   - **How to run:**
      1. **Clone the repository:**
         ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/arpita444/CBT-CIP
         ```
      2. **Open in VS Code:** Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
      3. **Build and run:** 
         - **Using the integrated terminal:** 
            - Navigate to the `digital_calculator` directory in the terminal.
            - Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code: 
              ```bash
              g++ -o calculator main.cpp [other_source_files.cpp] 
              ```
            - Run the executable:
              ```bash
              ./calculator
              ```
         - **Using a VS Code debugger:**
            - Create a launch configuration in VS Code (refer to VS Code documentation for details).
            - Debug and run the application.
